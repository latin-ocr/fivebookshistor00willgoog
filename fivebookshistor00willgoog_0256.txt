υ Seneca considers public spectaoles as so many places os seduc-
tion. Nothing, he says, is so dangerous as loitering at such diver·
sions, sor, when the heart is sostened by pleasure, the passione stand
ready sor the admission of every vice. How is this to be under-

v Maroboduus and Adgandestrius, two German kings, are sup·
posed to have been able to write, since their letters to Rome are

y The sacility with whio divorces were obtained at Rome, in-
troduced an indefinite¹ right of renouncing one marriage and em-
bracing another, as osten as caprice or a new passion dietated.
The letter os the law was observed, but the spirit was grossly coun-
teracted. Lusus eras ωσι-ω eonnubia saltere teda, says Martialz
and the same author, in an excellent epigram, tells us that the J u·
