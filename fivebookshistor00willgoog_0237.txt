p Lipsius is os opinion ‘that 'this passage will ever be the torment of “
the commentators. But the difficulty does not seem to be insurmoun-
table. Tacitus says, that the first emigrants from the other side of
the mina who entered Gaul, and dispossessed the nativa, were in
his time called Tungrians3 but when they undertook their expedition,
to strike their enemies with terror, ob meeum, they called themselves
Germane. The word, os course, implied something formidable‚ and,
by averti ⁰120 the etymology, it receives the following construction.
θὼν, ⁰¹· ⁸7²& signifies war. From that root the French have de·

⁴ rived their word guerre.. Mun, in the German tongue, implied the

same as it ‹loes now in that country and in England. Hence we find,
that the first invaders, ob metum, to spread a general alarm, called
‚ themselves Germans, or warlike men.

q The commentatore are much at variance about the reading os
the original word to express the recitation os the German poets.
Some of them contend sor barritus, instead os horditus ‚- for berria,
they say, significa the cry or roar of an elephant. Horace uses the
word barrus, sor an elephant. Mulier nigris dignissima bar-riu
Epod. 12. But Lipsius observes, that elephants were not lmown in
Ger-many. This dispute about a word, seems to be, as is usually the
case, os little or no importance. since it is evident that the poets of

Germany and Britain were called Barth, and therefore bar-ditus is,
probably, the true reading.

The stt-ains os verse which the ba poured forth in their fits of
enthusiasm, inflamed the German and e British warriors with he‘roic

“ fortitude. Perhaps nothing contributed more to make those nations
stand at bay sor such aJe os time with the whole power of the
Romans. The soldier sai to the hard, ⁶⁴. Come, and see me fighting
δ* for my country3 see me bleed, is the sate os war will have it sog and

ὃ* if 1 die, be sure to record my memory ” This was the ambition os
the northern natione.
