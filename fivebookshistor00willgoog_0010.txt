vi LIFE OF TACITUS. 1
tise on the manners of the Germans, a composition admired J
for the fidelity and exactness with which it is executed. ¹
His lise of Agricola, whose daughter he had married, is Α
celebrated for its purity, elegance‚ and the many excellent ³
instructions and important truths which it relates.

His history os the Roman emperors is imperfect. lt
embraced a period oftwenty·eight years, that is, from the
69th to the 96th year os the Christian era. Of this nothing ᾗ
remains but the history of the 69th year and part of the J
70th. Part of the fisth'book‚ containing three years of Ti·
berius 3 the entire four years of Caligula, the six first of ξ
Claudius, and the, two last of Nero, have perished in the ζ
wreck of literature. His annals were the most extensive ἰ
and complete of his works. Tacitus had reserved for his ζ
old 'age the reigns of Nerva and Trajan, and he also pro· ⁴
· posed to· give to the world an account of the interesting, ad· χ
ministration of Augustus 3 but these important subJects j
never ”employed the pen os the historiam and, as some of
the ancients observe, all the writings of Tacitus were con·
tained in thirty books, of which we have now lest only six· ,ἰ
teen of his annals and five of his history. The style of 2
Tacitus has always been admired for peculiar beauties 3 ⁴
the thoughts are great, there is sublimity, force, weight
and energy3 every thi'ng is treated with precision and dig-
nity 3 ’ yet many have called him obscure because he was
fond of expressing his ideas in a few words. His own la-
eonic manner, and, it ma be added, the omissions of theg
copyists, have occasione some difficulties3 but he, whm
‘has made himself familiar with the peculiarities ofthe style,'
will not be much embarrassed. By due attention to the
context, the true, or at least the probable meaning may al-
ways be found. His Latin is remarkable for its purity 3
and though a writer in the decline of the Roman empire,
he has not used barbarous expressions, but with him every
thing is sanctioned by the authority of the writers of the¹
Augustan age. ’ ι

Α profound judge of men, and a severe censor of man-
nerS, he has delineat'ed with the pencil of a master, the
characters and the very inward frame of the vile and pro-⁴
fligate 3 while the good and upright receive, in his immor-
tal page, the recompense due to their virtue.
