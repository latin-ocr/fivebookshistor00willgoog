Neptune 3 by whatever title the strange gods might be denominated.
The goddess Hertha, of our Saxon ancestors, seems tc be no other,
according ,to Tacitus, than the Mater Tellus os 'the Romans.” Ao-
coi-dim to this doctrine, we see in the tract cn the German Manae-rs, ‘ ·
s. 43, that under the name os Alcis, Tacitus found that the people

*worshipped Castor and Pollux. ln this sense, the Roman historiens

are to be understood, when theytell us, that savage nations worship-

ped Mars, arte Venus, and Minerva. Under barbarous appellatione»

they worshipped invisible powers, to whom they gave distinct sunc-

tions, as the Romans did in their own religious system. lt is there-

fore to be wished that Caesar had collected the names ascribed by the

Germans to their gods. In that case the seeming variance between

him and Tacitus would, most probably, vanish. But Caesar was en-

gaged in an important war with Ariovistus, and he did not pier-ce sar

into Germany. , ’

n Humari victims were offered to Mercury (or Hesus) as the
chief os the ¹(alei-inanffigods, and, according to-the texh‘certain animalsl
were sacrificed to Mars and Hercules. The Germans were osScy-
thian origin, and of course, retained much of the manners of tlseir an-

„ cestors. See Herodotus, book iv. The Celtic nations offered human

victims to their gods, and, accordingly, Caesar tells us, tha't the same
horrible superstition prevailed among the Gauls. In threatening dis-

. tempers or imminent dangers, they made no scruple to sacrifice human

victims, and made use os the ministry of their druids foi-*that purpose.
They put the victims alive into a colossus ofosier twigs, and all within
expired in the flames, Convicts for thest, robbery, or other crimes,
were thought most acceptable to the gods, and, when real criminals
were not to be found, the innocent were made to suffer. Caesar, book
vi. a. 15.

ο lt may be assumed as a fact, that the Germans, at the time when
Tacitus wrote his 'l¹reatise, had no representation of their gods in the
human ‚shape. Statuaries and artists did not fix their residence in
those regions. lt is certain, however, that in process os time, images
and statues abounded in Germany.

p Groves devoted tc superstition were frequentin Germany andin
Gaul. Mentionis made, θνηταῖς, ii. s, 12, os a wcod sacred to Hercu-
les. The forest of Barduhenna occurs. Απηαὶε, iv s. 73 . and in the

“ Hister-31, iv. s. 14, Tacitus describes a sacred grove. ·

Lucan’s description os a sacred grove ne'ar Marseilles, in the third

book of the Pharsalia, is well lmown to the classic scholar. The rites
