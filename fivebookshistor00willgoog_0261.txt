j The same love os liquor, with all its consequential mischiefs‚
has been obses-ved by all travellers ‘among the savage tr'ibes os Ame-
rica. Charlevoix says, the avarice os the Frenoh dealers introduced
drunkenness among them, and that in the streets of Montreal, hus·
hands, wives, fathers, mother-s, brothers and sisters were frequently
seen, in a state ofintoxioatiom worrying one another with their teeth,
like so many enraged wolves. Charlevoix‚ Journal os α Voyage to
North America, letter viii. To suppress the evil consequences of
intoxication among the Franks, the Salic law ordained‚ that is a man
were killed at a convivial meeting‚ in company with five or seven,
the survivors should convict one as the offender, or jointly pay the
composition sorbis death. Tit. De Homicidia in Comu'viosaclis.

sians (Cyropoedioe, lib. viii.) he was struck with the wonderful don-
sormity os the eastern natione to the manners of the ancient Germane.
See the speech os Civilis in a sacred grove, when all were watm with ·
liquor. Hisl. b. iv. s. 14. Plutarch in his Symposion, b. vii. qu. 9,
observes, that it was the custom os the Greeks, as wellas the Peninus, ·
to debete os state affairs at their convivial meetings. He refers to a,
passage in Homer, where Nestor advises Agamemnon to prepare a ,
feast, and then hear the ablest counsellor. For this Plutarch gives a
reason: There is, hesays, a wineless drunkenness excited by anger,
melica, ambition, and other turbulent passions3 but wine rather
overcomes the bad affectione, and stirs and agitates the generous emo·
tions of the heart. ‘Among the American savages‚ when any business
os consequence is transactam they appoint a feast upon the occasion,
