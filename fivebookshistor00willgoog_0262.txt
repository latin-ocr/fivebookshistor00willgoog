XXIV. Genus spectaculorum unum atque in omni coetu
iidem. Nudi juvenes, quibus id ludicrum est, inter gladios
ue atque infestae frameas saltu jaciunt. Exercitatio artem
paravit, ars decorem : non in quaestum tamem, aut merce-
dem: quamvis audacis lasciviae pretium est, voluptqs spec· '
tantium. Alcam (o) (quod mirere) sobrii inter seriaexer-

to make eheese. They convertet] it inte a kind os whey end butten -
end used it us en unguent. Nat. Hist. b. xi. e. 86. Sidonius Apoli-
naris, in n little poem on the Germane, tells us, that they made use os
butter to eil their hair. ‚

m The refinements of the culinary, scienee were unknown to the
Germana. Pomponius Mela says, that they sed on the rawgflesh os
animula, either recently killed, or aster it was pounded in the hide by
their feet and hands to some degree of sostnesn. See Mela, b. iii. ch.
3. The Romans, on the contrary, etudied the pleasures of the table,
and luxury was in such vogue, that, aa we are toldbyPliny, the price
of a triumph was not too much sor a good cook. The man who by
his exquisite skill could enable his master to eat up his fortune, was
in the highest request. Plin. lib. ix. s, 17.

n Thus we know, that the Europeans, when they settled in North-
Amerioa, soon found it their interest to supply the nativee with· spiritu·
ous liquore. They wuged a war os gin and brandy against the various
tribes, some es which have been subdued und others almost totally
extirpated, by their own drunkennese. See Charlevoix, letter viii.
The same writer says, that a savage, being asked by a French 'officer

⁷ what he thought the brandy, which he loved so much, was made os,
gave for answer: ‘'- lt is mede of tongues aud heare: ,- sor when Ι
have drunk os it, 1 sear nothing, and 1 talk like an angel? Letter
xxi. p 83.

ο The rege sor guming‚ which hus been observed among barbarie
ans in almost every qual-ter os the globe, may be accounted for with-
out much difficulty. The life of a savage is passed in war, in hunting,
fishing, and in soenes of plunder and rapine. When that employment
no longer' calls sor his exertions, he sinks down in listless indolence:
The ordinary occur-rences of the day have nothing to arouse his sacul-

, ties. ‘Pin-eu of himself andos languid apethy, he wants some object
to excite and agitate his passione. Gaming answers «this purpose.
Every thing is put to the decision os chance ς hope and fear eucceed
euch other ς and joy and ruge, and pleasure and disappointment, ex-
cite the strongest emotions of the soul. The danger os lesing his
whole steck, and even his liberty, relieves the mvnge from the op·
pressiori under which he laboured. The deeper the play, the more
hie passione are ularmed3 und that inward conflict, that agitation os
the mind, is the incentive that makes him deligh't in gumen os chance.
