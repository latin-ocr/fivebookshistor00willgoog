possession. In meantime os Augustus, Maroboduus, their king, u
0⁵³ breve, politio, and ambitious prince, saw that the hhine was not a
sufficient burriel· between him and the Roman arms. He resolved
ὡς - to seek a new habitation in a more remote part os the country. ‚Mi-
η, gratioris in Ger-many were attended with little difficulty. They had
κ. ne1ther fortified towns, nor houses strongly built, und all their wealth
he consisted in herds os cattle. Maroboduus, at the head of ‘the niar-
comsnni, marched into Bohemia, and expelled the Boians. Suebi&
v, being thus evacuated, the neighbouring (iauls were inxited by the
{0 fermity of the soil. A band of adventurers, supposed to be the Se·
-ε quani, the Rauraci, and Helvetii, took possession of the vacant lands;
μ and, being subjecte os the empire, they continued to own their former
ι masters, and, us was necessary in their new' situation, to crave the
protection os Rome. The Romans, in return, demanded a tenth os
the product of the lands. Hence they were called decurrentes.

j The territory os the Catu is said by the commentatore to have
been between the Rhine, the u'layne, the River Sala, and part ofthe
Hercyniun Forest near the Weser, now the oountries of Hesse, Thu-
ringis, part of Pederbom, and franconia. Brotier says, that what

Caesar, Florus, and Ptolemy have remarked of the Suevi, should al- ¹
ways be understood os the Catti. Leibnitz supposes that the people ¹

vere called catti, from some resemblance in point os egility to a cat,
the German word sor that animal being Catte.

k Brotier quotes a passage from· vegetius, in which that author
gives a lively description of the form and structure of body proper sor
a soldier. Let the youth intended sor a martial life have a quick

piereing eye, a neek firm and erect, an-open chest, broad end muscu- ⁷

lar shoulders, strong fingere, s length of urm, the belly not too pro·
minem, legs well shnped, without superfluous flesh either on the culs

or the soot, well braced with nard und close compacted sinews. Ve-
gentas, lib. i. cap. 6.
