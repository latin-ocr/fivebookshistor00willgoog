1 This was an improvement in military discipline beyond the
rest of the Germane. [n the Reman armies the general was the main
strength ς and accordingly Livy says, it was evident that the republie
succeeded more by her general officere than by the armies of the com·
monwealth. Ue faede appareret ducibus valzdivrem quum eamcam
rem flumanam esse. Livy, lib. ii. Florus expresses a εὶιιιιΙειι· thought
with his usual brevity; Tanta excreatus, quana imperator. Lib. ii.
cap. 18. . The velue of en army is in proportion to the skill of the ge-
neral. Quintilian agrees with the two historians; he says, 1f we
make a fair estimans, it is by military discipline that the Roman name
has flourished to this day with undiminished lustro. We do not
abound in numbers more than other nationsz nor are our bodies more

robust than the Cimbrians. We are not richer than many powersul ‘

m vows of this kind occur in the history of various nations. In
the days eschivalry the same custom prevailed‚ and manifestly owed
its origin to the practice οἱ· the Germana, who overran all Europe.
He who undet-took a bold enter-prise, or thirsted for revenge‚ made e
vow never to sleep in a bed, or take off his clothes day or night, till
he had executed his grand design. Upon this principle Civilis, the
Batavian chief, curtails his heir and beai-d as soon as he had· perform·

note on that e, mentions from the History of the Langobar-,du
six thousand axons, who survived the slaughter of their country-men,
and bound themselves by a solemn vow, neither to shave their heard·
