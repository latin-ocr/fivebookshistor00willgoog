· Vangiones, according to Brotier‚ occupied the diocese of W orm-⁹ ὅ the
Triboci, the diocese. of See-aebour35 the Nemetes the diocese os Spin.
Though originally Germana, they were all settled in Gaul be-
fore Caesar carried his victorious arms through every part of the
country. ·

g 'Phe Batavians are often celebrated ’oy Tacitus sor their bravery‚
their skill in swimming across rivers, and their faithful attachment to
the interest of Rome. ln the second book os the Αηηαὶε, s. 10, we
find them fighting under Germanicus. , In the fourth book of the his-
tory, they are said to be originally of the Cattian nation. Driven out
by their countrymen‚ they occupied a marshy island, formed by the
German Ocean and two branches of the Rhine. They adhered with
unshaken constancy to the Romans. They· served in Britain as aux·
iliaries, and in [taly under Vitellius. Inflamed at length by the‘tur-
bulent spirit os Civilis, they threw off the yoke‚ and, having stormed
the Roman encampments, obliged the legions to lay down their arms,
and even to swear fidelity to the empire of the Gauls. See the ac-
munt os this war in the fourth aud fifth books of the Hister-y. The
Batavian island is said in the Annals, b. ii. s. ὃ, to be formed by two
branches os the Rhineg one running in a direct course, and with a
rapid current, till it empties itself into the German Ocean; the other
more gentle, falling into the Vahal (now the wael.) and thence
through the broad mouth of the Mosa (the Meuse‚) into the Ocean.

h The Mattiaci irihabited landa between the Rhine and the Visur-
gis (the Weser.) Their country was partly in Weteravie and patt-
ly in Hesse. Brotier says, Mettium, their capital, is no'w called
· Marpurg, and that the sountains (Fontes Mattiaci) are known by tire

name of wne-baden, near Mentz. .
