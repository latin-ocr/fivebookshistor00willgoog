r Itis difficult tofix the residence of these two nationS. Ί he com· ” ι
mentators seem disposed to assign them the country near the head os
the river Lippen and thence it is thought that they removed to the
lands evacuated by the Angrivarians and Chamavians‚ when they exn
pelled the Bructerian nation. They seem to have been the same with
thosetwhom Velleius Paterculus calls the Attuarii ι see Patere. lib. ii.
s. 105. They were afterwards part of the Francic league. The.
ιιιαὺἰοιιε of inferior note, said by Tacitus to have dwelt in the neigh-
bourhood, are supposed by Brotier to have been the Ansiberii and
Tubantes. The former he thinks should rather be called Amsibarii‚
from their vicinity to the river Amisia.

s The Flevus‚ in the time os the Romans, was a great lake. Ger-
manicus entered it through the artificia! branch of the Rhene made
by Drusus. {annal-⁹, b. ii. s. 8. , It has been since enlarged by irrup-
tions of the semu-and is now the great gulf called Zuyder-Zee. -The
Lesser Frisiens were settled on the south-west side of the bey, occu·
pying theWhole or parvos Holland and Utrecht. The Greater Fri-
sians were on the north-east os the lake or gulf, in the territory now
called Groningen, ektending themselves along the sea-coast as fer as
the river Amisia (now the Ems.) The name of the Frisians seems
gi beopreserved in that of Friesland‚ the most northern of the United

rovmces. ⁷

t One of the inundatione which changed⁴ the lake into a gulf of the

² sea, happened so late as the year 1530, and swallowed up seventy-

two villages. Another} happened in the year 1569, and overwhelm-

ed the coast'ef Holland‚ and laid all Friesland un'der water. In that
flood no less than 20‚ooo persons lost their lives. where the pillars

of Hercules stood, cannot now be known with certainty. The ex-

treme point of land, where nothing bnt the open seo. lay beyond it,

was in ancient times said to be the spot on which the pillars os Her-

cules were ereoted„ Some 'os the commentatore contend that the “
spot intended by Tacitus was on the coast of the Frisiansz others will

have it to be the point of the Cimbrica Chersonesus, now Juuand.
