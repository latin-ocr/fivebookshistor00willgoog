the cavalry in battle, and served as a rear-guard. Is the action be·
came dangerous, they advanced to the relies of the troops. 1f any
horsemen was wouuded, and fell to the ground, they gathered round
to defend him. Is speed pras required, either sor hasty pursuit or
sudden retreat, they were so nimble and alert by continual exercise,

ε Germany was divided into states cr communities, each state into
cantum, end each canton into hundreda, or a hundred families. So
the Suevians were divided, according to Caesar, book iv, s. 1. The
swiss to this day are divided into cantone.

d The word wedge, importing a body of men drawn up in that
form, is aknown military term. The ranks are wide in the rear, but
lessen by degrees, and sharpen to a point in front, the better to break
through the lines os the enemy. 'l'he practice was universally in use

s The text in this place seems persectly clear, though various wri-
ters, sond of a particular hypothesis, have endeavoured to perplex it.
Some of those ingenious authors contend, that the kings irrGermany
were hereditary, and the general officers elective. But Tacitus says,
sumunt, they take or choose, and he applies the word to king- as well
as commandens in chief. Hence it may be fairly inserted, that in the
electiori os kings they had reg-ard to the nobility of an ancient raceg
but still they chose them. They chose, perhaps, out os certain fami·
lies, and gave the preference to the issue os the deceased king: but lt
does not appear that they werobounq by any lew os inheritance.
