n* Tacitus umes the words, pares valideque mmmurssshat 5⁸2 they
are married equa! and robust. Brotier understands the expression
as annifing tn ilie equality os conditions, or a marriage among per·
snus uf equa} fanin and he cites Iaws from the German code, au-
ἴιπηιηῃςζ pena-illies to those of both sexes who marry persons os inferior
rank. Bul. thu equality here intended by Tacitus, seems from the
context to be no other thau maturity os years in the contracting
parties. The distinctions of rank, which took place among the
Franks in Gaul, were unknown to the German tribes in their own
count .

‘e Trhyus we see that, by custom 5the unwritten law of the Ger·
mans,) the semales were excluded rom the succession to the lands
os their deceased father. ’ What those lands were is clearly explain·
‘od by Montesquieu. While the Franks, he says, lived in their own
country, their whole stock consisted os slaves, herds os cattle, hot-ses,
arms, and accoutr‘ements. Lands sor cultivation were assigned to
them by the state sor a year only, and after that 'time it was resumed
by 'the public. What then were the lands to which the male issue
succeeded? Every hut or nabin had a precinct of ground, aud that
was the estate that descended to the sons, or went in the male line·
ltwas called Salic land, because the mansion os a German was call-
ed Sal, and the space inclosing it Saltiae, the homestead. When
the Franks issued from their own country, and gained possessions in
Gaul, they still continued to give to their newsettlements the name
os Salic land; aud hence, the law of the Franks that regulated the
course of descent, was called the Salic Law. Rapin has lest us an
elaborate dissertation on the subject. He takes notice ostwo diffe-
rent editions os the Salio law3 but the last, it seems, is not correct.
From the tormer, Rapin states six rules ossuccession to land property.
1. lfa man dies without issue, his father or his mother shall inherit. 2.
lfhe leaves neither father nor mother, his brother or his sister shall
sncceed. 3. lr there is 'no survdving brother or sister, the sister os
his mother shall *ee entitled. 4. Is the mother has left no sister, the
sister of the father shall succeed. ὃ. ls the father has lost no sister,
the next relation os the malo line shall hare the estate. 6. No part
os the Salio land shall pass to the females3 but the whole inheritance
descende to the male line, that is, the sons shall be‘entitled to tho*
