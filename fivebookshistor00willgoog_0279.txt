h 'Phe Langobaids are supposed in the time os Augustus, to have ⁷
inhabited ‘the country' now-called Lunenbourg and Magdebourg‚ on
the-west side of the Elbe. Velleius Paterculus says, they were sub·
dued byTiberius, when he commanded in Germany, end that, they
were· a people that exceeded, ‚evenv German ferocity'. [Veli. Pa‘talib.

tus has 'made no mention of the Burgundians‚ perhaps because they
were in his time of little or no considerationg though at the end of “
several centuries 'they were able to make an irruption into Gaul,
where they possessed the'c‘ountry, which, aster them, is to this day call-

i With regard t'o the seven nations‘ here enumerated,¹there ιιι-ἐ no
lights os history to guide us atthis distent period. Brotier supposes
that the Rudignians dwelt in what is now called Mecklenbourg and
Lawenbourg. The Aviones, h'e thinks, were situated in a portion of
the duchy οἱ Mecklenbourg, near a river, ‘whichffifter their name, is
called Ava by the inhabitants. The Van-inians are generally thought
to have occupied the eastern part of Mecklenbourg‚ where the city of
W'aren stands a't present. The Eudosians, the Nuithones, end Sucr-

’ doninus are almost lost in the mists of antiquins. The Angles are
better known. They occupied part os Holstein end Sleswiek. ln
the fisth century they joined the Saxons in their ‘expedition to Bri-
tain, and, by giving the name of England to the southern part of the
island, immortalized the glory of t‘heir nation. “

j As Tacitus is here speaking of the adoration paid to a goddess by-
the several nations whose names have been enumerated, it is not pro·
bable that, in latinizing eberbarous word, he should give 'it a mascu-
line termination. The text says, Herthum, id est, Terram Matrem
colun't. So, it seerns, the word stands in all the manuscripts ς and
yet, it may be p‘resum‘ed‚ that the author *wrote Hertham. The
name in all the northern 'languages signifles earth3 in the ancient
Gothic, circha ,- in the Anglo-Savon‚ cartha, artha, bertha ,- in Eng-

· lish, earth. See Nor-thern Antiquities‚ vol. . 92. The worshi os
