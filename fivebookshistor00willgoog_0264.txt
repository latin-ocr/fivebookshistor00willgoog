XXVI. Fenus agitare et in usuras extendere, (u)*igno·
tum3 ideoque magis servatur, quam si vetitum esset. Agri,
pro numero cultorum, ab universis per vices (v) occupan-

in their new possessions, became acquainted with money,- the cere·
mony ofenfranchisement was performed by striking out of the slave’s
hand a denarius, and from that circumstance the freedman was call-

ed Denariatus. Their rank, however, was little higher than that of ἱ

a slave3 and. by the Ripuarian law, tit. lvii. lex. 4, if a freedman
died without issue, his fortune went to the public treasury.

s As often as an opportunity offers, Tacitus has an eye to the man- “
ners os his own, country. He glauces, in this place, atPallas, Nar·
cissus, Icelus, and others of that description, who, under Claudius,
Nero, and Galba, rose to the first eminence in the state. The ty-
ranny os such men was a galling yoke to every liberal mind. Nerva,
Trajan, and the Antonine-³„ never trmisacted' any kind of public bu-
siness by the interventiou of their sreedmen. We are told that Adri·
an, seeing one of his slaves walking with a familiar air, between two
senators, ordered a person to go directly and give the impudent sellow
a box on the sace, with this monition, ‘⁶ Learn more respect ¹for those
to whom you may be transferred, as a slave.'’ Tacitus informs us,
that Agricola never suffered his slaves nor free-<lmen 'to play the part
of agents in the affairs os his administration. See Life os Agricola, s.
19. It is obser-ved by Montesquieu (Spiril ⁰s Laws, b. xv. ch. 18,)
that the freedmen under the emperors paid their court to the wesk·
nesses of their masters, and then taught them to reign by their vices,
not their virtues. lt is remarkable that the same abuse of power,
that prevailed at Rome ,under the worst of the emperors, was also
sselt in those parts of G-ermany, where monui-chy and despotism were
established. ’

t We have here four distinct ranksz the nobles, the men os in·

enuous birth, the freedmen, and the slaves. In Gaul, according to

aesar, there were two principal orders of men, the druids and the
nobles, the common people being little better than slaves. Book vi.
’ s. 12. The Franks, in imitation of their German ancestors, had
four classes of men3 their nobles, their ingenuom, their Lidi, and
their slaves; and this, Montesquieu observes, is clearly proved by the
composition sor offences proportioned to the different ranks of the se·
veral complainantS. Spirit ⁰s Laws, b. xxx. ch. 25. See Menwires
dal'Acad. ἀεὶ Belias Letters, vol. xxxvii. p. 541.

u The practice os laying out money at exorbitant interest, and exi
acting payment with harsh severity, was an ancient grievaace at
Rome. and a perpetual· cause of clamour and sedition. Laws, it is
true, were made at various times to suppress the mischies ς but those
lawss wer? elude& because, as Tacitus says, the public good gave
way to private emolument. See Annats, b. vi. s. 16.
