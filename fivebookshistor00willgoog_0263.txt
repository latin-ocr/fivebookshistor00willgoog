Brotier quotes a remarkable passage stom St. Ambrose, who gives a
lively picture os a barbarous people engaged at play. The Hune, he
says, a fierce and warlike tace, are always subject to a set os murem,
who lend them what they want {sor the purposes of gaming. They
live without lawe, and yet obey the laws os dice. , Et cum sine legi-
bus vivant, aleoe eoum legibus obedire. St. Ambrose adds, that when
the unsuccessful gamester has lon his all, he sets his liberty, and even
his lise, upon a single cast, and is accounted inlamous if he does not
pay his debts os honbur.

p See in Tacitus (Annals, b. xiv. s. 43‚) an account os Pedanius·

, Secundus, who had fourscore servants in his family, with specific

names for their several departments. This was called his city esta-
blishment, familia urbana. In the country the Romans had their
rural slaves under different appellatione. ln Get-many the slaves
were praedial servants, not indeed at liberty, but annexed to the soil,

, gleboe adscripti. Their condition, Brotier observes, was the same as

that of the vassals, or serfs, who, a fe‘w centuries ago, were so numer·
ons in every part of EuropeL The German conquerors, in imitation

‘ , os the Romans, had their real slaves, while those who remained in a

state of rural vassalage vvere called Lidi. This distinction a pears in

Villenage was a species of tenure manifestly derived from the Ger- ’
mans.

q A composition was paid for homicide; but still, it seems, a man
might lcill his slave with impunity. The Salio law provided aster·-
vvards, that he who killed the slave of another, was obliged to pay a
certain fine, and the expense es the suit.

his deoeendants were Libertini. *ln 'process ostims, when the rrimus,
