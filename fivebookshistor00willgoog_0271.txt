Tencteri, super solitum bellorum decus, equestris discipli-

the hair was known ιο Silius Italicus; and accordingly, that poet
mentions, among the slain in one‘of his battles, a Gau 1,- who hed
bound himself by a similar vow, never to be shorn till he returned
victorious from the field of battle. Bell. Punic. lib. iv. v. 200.

n This custom of voluntat-ily putting on a badge of slavery, was
observed by the descendants of the Germuns in various parts of Eu-
rope, andin the times of chivalry, seems to have grown into gene-

John, Duke of Bourbon, to distinguish himself in the service of his
mistress, associated himself with sixteen lmights and ''squires, who
all joined him in a vow, by which they obliged themselves to wear a
ring round their lest legs on every Sundey for two years3 that of the
knights to be gold, and that of the gentlemen silver. And this they

. were to perform till it should be their lot to meet with nn equal num·

ber of knights and ’squires to engage with them in the toumnment.

υ The Usipii are supposed to have occupied the duchy of Cleves‚

and they, he says, with the Tenctheri, were driven by the Suevians
from their territories; and, having wanden-ed over many regions of
Ger-many during a space of three years, they settled at lust on the

‘ · bunks of the Rhine, near the Mennpiens, who hed lanas on both sides

of the river. ΟΜ, b. iv. s. Ι. Afterwards, in the reign of· Augus·
