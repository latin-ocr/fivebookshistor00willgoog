u TacituS, perhaps, alluded to the precept of the philosopher, who
said, ‘⁸ Worship God, believe in him, but do not presume to investi·
gete his nature :” Deum cele, atque crede, ced noli quoerere. The an·
ciente, says La Bletterie, thought it presumptuous to inquire too far
into the myster-ies of nature3 and the moderna do not spere the mys-
teries os religion. =
'⁸ v Theterritory of the Chaucians extended from the Ems (Amisia)
to the Elbe, (Albis) and the German ocean washed the northern
extremity. The natiou was distinguished into the Greater aad the
Lesser, divided from each other by the Visurgis (the Weser). The
former dwelt (as appears in Annals, b. ii. s. 18 and 19) between the
Ems and the Weserz the latter on the northeast side of the Weser,
between that river and the Elbe. Pliny, in his Natural Histoi-y, has
represented the maritime inhabitants in lively colours. He says, he
himself had seen the Greater and the Lesser Chaucians, living in a
vast level country, which is overflowed twice in the day and night
by the refiux of the tide, and leaves a perpetual doubt whether it is
sea or land. Pliny adds, that the wretched inhabitants live on the
ridge of hius, or inv mud cottages, raised above high water mark,
having no cattle, no milk, and no fruits os the earth. Fish is their
only sustenance, and they catch it with lines made os nugs and sea-
weed. Their fuel is the common mud, taken up with their hands,
and dried rather by the wind than the sun. With fire made of
this kind of peat, they warm their food and their bodies almost fro-0
zen. The rain-water, collected in ditches around their hats, is their
only drink. Pliny, lib. xvi. s. 1.
