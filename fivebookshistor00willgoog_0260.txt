:tin the principle os the composition was a satisfactioni to the in-
jur-ed party. Avarice was called in to appease revenge. A debt
was supposed to ne due sor the crime committed, and this appears to

have been established m the remotest ages, This mode ot' compo· -

sition for crimes and inJuriee was adopted by the various commu-
nitio: in Germany; but their descendants, aster their irruption
¹into Gaul, Italy, and Spain, still claimed the right os waging pri-
vate war sor private injuries. Hostilities continued during a num·

ber os years, aud the animosity of the contending parties laid a ⁶

scene oi'·blood. Charlemagne endeavoured by a positive law to
aboliah the mischies; but the genius of one man was not sufficient
to eradicate a custom so firmly established. See Robertson, Hm.
os Charta V. vol. i. p;54.

h Tacitus ie confirmed by Julius Caesar‚ who says, the lawa of
hospitality are inviolable among the Germana. Their visiters are
eure of a cordia] reception. Their housee are open to every guest.

i. The manner in which the Romans placed themselves at table,
differ-ed from most other natione. Three couches called triclinia,
were ranged in order, but so as to leave the end os the table open [or
the approach of the servants. Three persons lay, in effeminate luxu-
ry, on each of the couchesz sometimes four or five. Cicero, in Piso-
nem, says, there ,was nothing iu his house neat or elegant. Five
Greeke and often more, lay crowded on one coucb. Nihil apud
hune lagaeam, nihil elegam. Groecz quini stipati in lectulis, soepc
plures. Tacitus seems neven-tu be better pleased‚ than when he
has opportunity οἱ passing an oblique cenaui-e on the manners os the
Romans. Accordingly we find, that the Germana in a more manly
way seated themselves each at his own table.
