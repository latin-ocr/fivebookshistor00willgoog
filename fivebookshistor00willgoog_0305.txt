p Each province paid to the Romans a tribute of corn, which, in
general, was paid in kind. In those provinces which had voluntarily
submitted to the dominion of Rome, the sarmer delivered the tenth
part os his erop. This was what in modern phrase is called lyme corn,

frumentum decumanum. In the conquered provinces, the Romans
exacted a gross quantity, fixing the bushel at a stated rate. This was
called stu-mentam stipendiari am. Besides those two modes ofcollect-
ing, it was further expected that the inhabitants of the several pro·
vinces should furnish, at a settled price, whatever was required for
the use of government: this was called purchased corn, frumentum
emptum. .The provinces were further charged with a supply sor the
use os the proconsul, or governor3 but the price was arbitrary, at the
will and pleasure of the governor himself. This was not always paid
m kind. A composition was made in money, and t'nis was called corn
at a voluation,srumentum aestzmtum. η
