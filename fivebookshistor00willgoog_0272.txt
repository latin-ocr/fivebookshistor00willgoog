p The Bructerians dwelt between the Rhine‚ the Luppia (the Lip-
pe,) and-Amisia (the Ems.) The country is now supposed to be
Westphalia, and over-Issel. They entered into an alliance with Ci-
vilis, ¹the Batavian chief ς and, having in the course os that var in-
curred the hatred of their countrymen, they ‚were at length exter·
minated. lt is observable, however, that Tacitus does not state the
tuin of this people as a positive fact. He, mentions it as a report.
That they were still a people appears in a letter of Pliny, who wrote
in the time of Trajan. The emperor, he tells ua, decreed a trium·
phal statue to Vestritius Spurinna, who, without the necessity os
coming to an engagement, humbled the Bructeriam by the terror os
his name. The barbarinos had experienced his courage and his con-
duct, and therefore not onlyreceived their king from him, but quiet·
ly submitted to their former government. Pliny, lib. ii. epist. 7. 1t
is probable, therefore, that Tacitus was misinformed.

q The Chamavians occupied a territory near the banks os the
Amisia, (the Ems) supposed to be Lingen and Osnaburg. The An-
grivarians bordei-ed on the Visurgis, (the Weser) where at present
are Minden and Shawenburg. 'Jhey were also called Angrariiz a
word which, Gronovius observes, according to the German etymolo-
gy, signifies aggressura. Brotier says, they were afterwards a part os
the Saxon nation3 and, for proof of this, he refers to the code of Sax-
on laws. The same writer adds, that the battle which] in conjunc-
tion with the Angrivarians, they fought against the Bructerians, was
decided on a plain near the canal of Drusus, (see s. xxix. note a) and
the account of that prodiglous slaughter arrived at Rome in the fioet
year of the emperor Trajan. Tacitus on this occasion seems to exult
in the destruction os the human species. ‘⁶ Above sixty thousand os
the Germans,'' he says, ‘⁶ lay dead on the field of battlez a glorious
spectacle sor the legionS, who beheld that scene of blood.'’ The nm-
bition of the Romans aiming always at universal dominion, it was
part of their policy to give the name of barbarinos to the natione that
did not tamely submit to their victorious arms. The combats os
their gladiator-s inured them to blood and carnage from their very
infaney3 and, by consequence, they considered the race of men as εο
many victims, who were to bleed sor the ambition of a people who
aspired to be the governors of the world. To conquer the proud
(debellare ‚superbo-s was astate maxim, and moraLvirtue gave way to
fieree ambition. here is a passage in Livy not unlike what is said
by Tacitus, but not delivered with the same harshness os expression.
A contention‚ he says, arose between the Volsci and the AEqui‚„each

, claiming a right to ame a commanderin chief for their confederata

army. A violent 'tion followe‘d, and the consequence was a bloody
engagement, in ‘which the good fortuneossthe Roman people destroy-
ed two annies os the enemy. Livy, lib. ii. 40.
