Chastity was in higher respect among the tribes of Germany. Ac-
cording to Valerius Maximus, the Cimbrian women who mar< hed
with the army into Italy, were all virgins, and assigned that reason

· to Marius, when they made it their request to be admitted into the

vestal order. -

z Great‘latitude was allowed by the Roman law to. the paternal
authority. The father, contrary to all the rights os nature, had an
absolute jurisdiction over his children. He could condemn them to
death. Such a power, nothing short os absolute dominion, gave
birth to a train os evils. Infante were abandoned, thrown into ri-
vers, and exposed to wild beasts. See Minucius Felix, in Octavio,
cap. 50. . ’

α J ustin says os the Scythians, Justice is cultivated in that coun-
try morg through the disposition os the peo‘ple‚ than by declarator-y
laws. Justie-o‘a gentis angmiis culta, non legibus. J nstin, b. ii. ch.
3. The same writer adds, lt is altogether astonishing that natural
instinctshould teach a navego race, what neither moral suadem, nor ‘
the precepta os philosophy, could establish in Graece. -Elegant
manners yielded to uninstructed nature. lgnorance of vice did
more among barbari-ans than all the boasted systema of a polished
nation. sustin, lib. iia. 2.

b Seneca, on the subject os training a youth in the way he is to
follow, says, is he wa.- born in Germany, be would, even in his iu·
fancy, brandish his little javelin. ln another work, he mentions the

promptitudo osshe German mind; the love of arms, to which the
’ are born and bred, their patience and firmum under every hardy·
ship3 and their neglect οἳ all covering for their bodies, while they
have no retreat to shelter them from the inclemency of the
weather. . ν

ο The age os manhood seems to have commenced at the end ol*
their twelsth year. Stout and well-grown boys were capable os
bearing arms, in a country where the soldier was equipped with
light armour. Hence King Theodoric says, Itis absurd that the
young men, who are fit for military service. should be deemed inea-
pable ol· conducting themselves.. Valour fixos the age osmanhood.
