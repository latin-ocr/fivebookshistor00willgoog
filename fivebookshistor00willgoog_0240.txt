Brotier informs us, stiam, or priam, was their νεαροῦ in nlnost ull
the bnttles recorded by chitus. From the ποι-ἀρήια, the Reman
writer easily made the term framea, more consonant to the idiom 'oi'
the Latin langunge. lt· appearsin the Annaea, book ii. s. 14, that
those instrumenta were of an enormous size, and unwieldy in close
engagement. 'The number was not sufficient to nrm more than the
front line os their army. The rest carried short darts or clubs har-
deued by fire. ln general, pointed stenes were prefixed to their-dwen-
pons‚ miilssmnny of these, Brotier says, have been discovered in Ger·-
ω se chres. ·

s Tli'e only covering os ο, German was a short mantle. Their sol-
diere, for the most part, were naked. All, however, were carious
in the embellishment of their shields, which we find, Armate, ii. s. 14,
were no't made os iren, but os osier twigs interwoven‚ or of thin
boards decorated with gaudy colours. These shields were the de·
light of the German soldiers. They were, et first, thepnsigns of vu-
Iour‚ aad afterwards os nobility. The warlilre chief made it his stu·
dyto ndorn his shield with variegated colours and the figures of nni-
mals, to distinguish his own martial prowess3 and what m the begin-
ning was merely personia, became in time hereditary. Hence what
we now call cents os arms peculim· to the descendants, os particular
families; nnd hence the origin os heraldi-y. 'Phe shield os a German
was his only protectior! in the heat of un engagement. Brenn-platee
were worn by a few only. 'rhe head-piece was os two sortsz one
made of metal, to which the Romans gave the name of caetis ,· the
second of ieamer, called galea.
