n The Germana distinguished the crimes which were prejudicial
to the State, such as treamn and desen-tion, from cowardice, which
they ranked with those unnatural passion· that ought never to be
heard os in society. The enemy os his country was punished as a
public example. Private vices, in themselves base and flagitious,
were considered as disgraceful to the guilty, not as an extensive mis·
chief, and therefore sw'ept' away from the notice and the memory of
man. Ignominious offenders were suffocated in mad, and their bo-
dies were concealed from sight, ,to be forgotten as soon as possible,
This distinction os crimes and punishments continued so long, that, by
a law os the Burgundians, the wife, who proved false to her husband,
- was in like manner put to death in the mud. Bau-ganam Laws, tit.

u In the list of crimes, for which a fine or composition was allowed,
homicide, adiutery, thest, and other personal injurios were included.
See this Traet, s. 21. The laws, which the Germans establish in
their new settlements, when they quitted their foi-ests, and overran
all Europe, are the best commentary on Tacitus. They confirm him

turally bring with them their primitive ideas, and transsuse them into

all the laws established in the conquered country. Whoever will be .

at the pains os examining their code of laws, will soon perceive, that
in their various fines for offences committed, they attended altogether
to the quantity of the damage, the malice expressed or implied by
the deed, and the rank os the person injured.

= , The fine in Gen-many was a mulct of cattle, the only riches of the

country3 but in process of time, when the Roman empire was over-
turned, and the invaders became acquainted with money, the fines

· were-pecuniary. By the Ripuarian laws, instead of the penul sum,

called the weregild, the composition might be made in cattle, at the
option of the offender. ν

ὁ The whole country of Get-many was divided into different States.
In some os these monarchy was established, and in others the republi-
can form of government. The former submitted to king83 the
latter had their chiefs. In Germany the leader of armies was elec·
tive. In each State or tribe, the divisions were, lst, the ople g ley,
the cantoris, or shires, as they are called in Britain ς y, the vici, σι·
hundreds. Magistrates were chosen in general conventiam os the
paple, to preside in the several cantons and hundreda.
