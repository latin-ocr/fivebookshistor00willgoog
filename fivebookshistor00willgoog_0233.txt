a Augustus Caesar divided part of Belgio Gaul into two provinces, ,,

distinguished by the names os Upper and Lower Germany. Many
os the new settlers in those parts were originally Germans, and, when
the whole country was reduced under subJ'ection to the Roman em-
pire‚ the people, unwilling to pass for natives of Gaul, still retained
their original name. Those two provinces called the Upper and
Lower Germany, being, in fact, part of Gaul, are not comprised in
the account given by Tacitus. He speaks os ancient Germany, call-
ed Germania Antiqua, or Barbara3 of Germany on the eastern side
os the Rhine, Germania Transrhenana3 bounded, on the west by the
Rhine3 on the south by the Danube3 on the cast by the Vistula, or
Weissel‚ and the mountain of Sarmatiaz and finally by the N orthem
Ocean, including the Baltic, andthe gulfs of ‘Bothnia and Finland.

b Gaul, according to Caesar, was divided into three parts, namely,
1. Belgio Gaul, bounded by the Scine, the Marne, the mountains of
Vauge‚ the Rhine, and the Ocean. ley, Celtic Gaul, bounded by
the Oceam the Scine, the Mai-ne, the Saone, the Rhone, and the Ga-

‘ronne. '3dly‚ Aquitania, bounded by the Atlantic Oceqm, the Ga-

ronne, and the Pyrenees.

duced‘ by the emperor Trajan to a Roman province. lt lay on the'
other side of the. Danube, extending northward to the Carpathian
mountaim, comprising part os Upper Hungary, Transylvania, Wala-
chia, and Moldavia.
