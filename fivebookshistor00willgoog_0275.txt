ε Tho territory of the Cheruscans began near the Weser (Visur-

' ), and extended to the Elbe, through the countries now called

uuebourg, Brunswiok, snd part of Brandenbourg. Arminius, their
chief, mede head against the Romans with distinguished bravery,
and performed a number of guilant exploits, ss related by Tacitus m

pe subordinate to that nation.
