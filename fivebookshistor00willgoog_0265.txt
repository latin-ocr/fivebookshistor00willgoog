not seem to be material. It is, however, ascertained by Caesar, that
the magistrate· portioned out yearly to every canton or family a
quantity of land ιιι what part of the country they thought proper, -
andin the next year removed to some other spot. Many reasons are
assigned sor this practice3 lest seduced by habit and οοιιιίιιιιιιιιοε,
they should learn to prefer tillage to war, lest a desire os enlarging
their possessions should prevail, and prompt the stronger to expel the ⁷
weaker· lest they should become curicus in their buildings, in order ·
to guard against the extremes of heat and cold3 lest avarice should “
get footing among them3 and, in fine, ιο preserve contentment and
equanimity among the paople, when they find their possessions noth·
ing inferior to those of the most powersul. De Bell. Gall. lib.

w In the first ages os the world, the year was distinguished by two
seasons' only. Moses mentions seed· time and harvest, summer and
winter. Genesis, ch. viii. ln process of time, the exertions of ιιι- ⁴
dustry marked out other periods3 but all that the Germans wanted
of the earth was corn and grain, and, the harvest being over, they
had no fruits to expect in autumn Brotier εει-γε, the Germans at
this day have no dis tinet word in their language sor the autumnal
season. The term that satisfies them is Herbst, harvest. Beyond
that period, the ancient Get-mans knew no productions os the earth5
having neither ‹ii-charde nor fruit· trees· and accordingly the Anglc·
Saxon language has no name for autumn. That word· ιιι English was
bort-owed from the Latin. The sall of thelensis a paraphrastical ’
expression, denoting that season of the year by the decay os nature, ,
not by the maturity os her fruits.

:c The simplicity of the Germans is placed by Tacitus, as osten as
the occasion pennits, ln direct conti-ast to Roman luxury aad magni-
ficence. Pliny relates, that Caecilius Claudius Isidorus ordered for*-
himself a pompous fimeral, which eost a sum almost incredible. Book
xxxii. And the same author says, that Arabia does not produce m a
‚whole year the quantity os spice consumed by Nero at the funeral of

Poppae. Book xii. The Romans beri-owed their superfluous pomp
