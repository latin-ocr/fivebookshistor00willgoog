succession. Rspin has entered into along discussion, but Montes·
quien was masteros his subject, and with the brevity of Tacitus, has
placed the whole in the clearest light. The rule among the Ger·
mans in their own country was, that the Salio land should gn to the
sword, aud not to the distaff. Tn'e daughters were excluded, be·
cause they passed by marriage into other familios- The Salic law
was founded on the customs and manners of Germany. ls the father
lest children, the daughters were ex'cluded, and the right os inherit·
ance vested in the sons. 'I‘hewell known law of the French mo-
narchy, which excludes. the female line from1 the succession to the·
crown, had its origin in the woods os Germany. tt is true that, in'
process of time, the law os the Franks gave *way to the civil law;
and women, though incapable of persormmg military duty, were al-
lowed to succeed to fiefs, which, sor that reason, were called impro-
per fiefs. The Salio law lost its force in France‚ except as to the suc·
cosmon to the crown, in which respect it has remained inflexible from
the earliest period of the monarchy to the present time. ,Spirit os
Laws, b. xviii. cum. See also Rapin's Dissertation-

s ln the rude state of society before men had any notion os an
umpire or magistrate to decide their differences, it was natural that
every man should exercise a right to repel injuries from himself and
his family. lt was also natural that he should demand atonement
srom the wrong-doer. Resentment is an active principle in the
srame of man. ln the minds ossavages it inflamed a spirit of revenge-
Their relations, their friends and their clun, joined in the qu'arrel.
Whole tribes waged war against each other sor the salte of an iudi·'
vidual. Ties os consanguinity and the sentiments of social affection,
contributed to aggravata the miscbiet'. Every rude uncivilized state
was filled with intestine broile. lt was the pride os a German to ex ,
pect redress from the vigour ofhis own arm. And yet we see sonu
rudiments os civil society among the ancient Gen-mans. They be·
gan to form an idea osa publio interest in the preservationi os ce.
We have seen in this tract, s. xii. that a composition sor o enee·
was made by a mulct os cattle, and that the king or ohiess of the
State received a fine sor the violation οἱ the public peace. The
savage, who before that time depended on his own martial vigour,
was willing to resign his resentment to the direction of the magis.
trate and to receive a stated compensation. The spirit of revente
wamppeassm and the aeadtyseud ol· course gave way to the new

ri iotion.
