vander in every soa. Tacitus mentions it as a romantio tale, but

Sta-abo seems willing to countenance the fiction, and, for that pur·

goze, grav-ely tells us, that Ulyssee founded a city, called odysseam m

actera, are a bad support os the systema advanced by theoretical νη- „
tere. Tacitus has shown, Anneio, xi. s. 14, that the use osalphabeti-
cal letters passed from the Phoenicians into Greeoe, and *from Greece
into Italy and Gaul, particularly to Mai-seinos. Caeenr relatam). 1·

s. thhat a roll was found in the Helvetian camp, written in Greek ·

characters, and containing e list of all (including old men, women,
and children‚) who had set out in the expedition against the Roman
army. ln book vi. s. 13, he expreesly says, that the Druids did not
commit their statutes to writing‚ but in all other matters made use of
Greek characters. Those characters passed from Gaul into Germa·
ny, where Count Marsili und others have found several monuments
with Greek inscriptions· , ,

t This wonderful similitude throughout the whole raoe has been
remarked by various authors. Juvenal mentions their yellow ΒΨ,
their blue eyes, and other circumstances that made the whole utnon
appear to be one family. . ἦ
