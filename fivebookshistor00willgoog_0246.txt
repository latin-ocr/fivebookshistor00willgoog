gloom οἱ a thick forest, are there displayed with a masterly hand ι
μ but, perhaps, Seneca has given the philosophical and true reason. He
says, if you enter a dai-k wood, where high embowering trees enclude
the light os the sun, the prodigious growth and losty majesty os the
wood, the solitude os the place, and the deep impenetrable gloom,
all conspire to impress an awsul stillness, and to fill the mind with ideas
of the invisible power os a superior Being. Seneca, epist. 41.

q The Scythians, according to Herodotus, book ir. had their divin-
ing twigs. The manner in which they were used, is explained by
Saxo Grammaticus, Hist. os Dentrem-k, book xiv. who says, that the

, Rugians, a people bordei-ing on the Baltic Sea, threw into their be-
soms three pieces of wood, partly white, and partly black; the for-
mer denofing success, and the letter adverse fortune.

r Caesar says, b. i. s. 50. that, among the Gauls, the matrone of the
family presided to decide by lots and divination. The case, undou'bt-
edly, was the same in Germany. -

s Iustanoes os this superstition are recorded among the Persians.
Darius wat elected king by the neighing of a horse. Herodotus, b.
iii. The same author, b. i. mentions a number os white horsea con·
sidered as sacred by Cyrus and> his army. J ustin relates the eleqtion
os Darius in the following manner. The competitors for the regal
diadem agreed, that, on a stated day, the horsea os the several candi·
‹htes should be drawn out before the palaeae, and he, whose horse was
first heard neighing, should be chosen king. The reason of this cere-
mony was the persuasion of the Persians, who believed the sun to be
the only god, and that allhorses were consecrated to him. J ustin, b. i. ·
s. 10. In the isle os Rugen a priest took auspices from a white horse,⁴
, as appears in Saxo Grammaticus. Danista Hirtam. b. xiv.
