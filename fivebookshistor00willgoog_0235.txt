h The inhabitants os every nation, that had no literary monuments,
were by the ancients deemed the immediate offipring os the soil. The
world is now better informed. Asia is ·considered as the country
where the numbers os mankind multiplied wit-h rapid increase, and
thence, overflowin into Scythia, peopled the northern regions os
‚Eut-ope. Under w ' h os the sons of Noah that vast migration was
formed, it is now fruitless to inquire. Antiquarians have amused
themselves with systema founded on vain opinions, an'd, having no his- '
torical recorda, they have' wandered in a maze os wild conjecture,
without contributing to the stock os real knowledge.

i In this passage a mistake seems to be justly imputed to Tacitus.
The first migrationis could not be made by sea in those early ages,
when the use ofshipping was little known. As soon as population in-

creased in Asia, the redundant multitude went forth in questos new ό ·

settlements, and poured into Scythia, Sarmatia, {Iungam and Poland,

’ ’ · and thence into Germany. When navigation began to be in some

degree understood, colonias were transplanted by sea. lt was by sea

that Cecrops conveyed his people from Egypt into Greece, and it was

in the same Jnanner that the Phoenicians transported their colonies to

the coast of Africa. But ,migrations must have been made before

bihe‘i'oe events, and the northern parts os Europe were peopled long
ore.

j ln the time os Tacitus, a voyage from Italy to the N orthem Ocean

would have been an enterprise too wild and daring. Drusus, the Ἣ

father of Germanicus, was the first Roman commender who ventured
to explere those seas. ¹ . .

k This is by no means a satisfactory reason sor the position advanced
by Tacitus, namely‚ that the Germana ,were the indigenous offspring
os the soil. In those remote ages, when the numbers os one nation
overfiowed into another, the object was not the most delightful coun-
try, but the sasest habitation. Asia, Italy, andsome parts os Africa,
afford delightsul spots ς but to men who could not find a settlement in
those regions, even Germany, which appears so hon-id to Tacitus,
was not without its conveniences. The ,people escaped. from orien-
tal despotism, and lived in freedom. A freehold, says Addison, though

- but in ice or snow, will make the owner pleased with the possession,

and stout in the desence os it.

ι Songs and rude poeti-y have been in all savage countries the me·
morials of public transactione. - Kings and heroes were the poeta and
historiam of the Scythica, the Celtic, and the northern natione. Saxo
