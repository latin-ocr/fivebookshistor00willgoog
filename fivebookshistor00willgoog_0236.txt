Grammaticus and other writers inform us, ‚that they drew their mate·
rials from Runic Songs, or lcelandic poetry'. The Gauls had their
Druids, the priests and philosophers os the nation, who preserved
their doctrine by oral tradition, and verses committed to memor-y on-
ly. The Germans had their Bards, who in their songs recorded all
public transactione, and sung the praises os their warriors and illus-
trious men. At all feasts and public assemblies the bards were the
panegyrists os exalted merit. 'l‘he same was the case in Britain,
Wales, and lreland. The songs of the bards w'ere the prelude to bat·
tle3 they inspired the chietis with enthusiastic ardour. When Ed·
ward Ι. formed the plan of reducing Wales to subjectioni, he thought
it necessary to destroy all the bards. The scandinaviam had their

, poets, or Scalde, whose business it was to compose odes or songs, in
which they celebrated the warlike achievements of their ancestors.
The praises which those poets gave to valqm, the enthusiasm which q
animated their verses, and the care which the people took to learn
them siem their insancy, all conspired to rouse the martial spirit os
their armies. Mallet's Northem Antiquitas, vol-,i- p- 223·

m Various opinions have been advanced by antiquarians concerning
the name of Tuisto. Some asser-t that it means the creator o's the'
world3 and that Mannus‚ which is man with a Latin termination,
relates to Adam. Others will have it, that 'Tuisto is the same as Teu-

. “ tates, a Scythian or Celtic king3 and much learning has been laid
Α* “ “ ‚out upon the subject. It is sufficient that he was the most ancient dei-
ty of the Gehmc‘im and Scandinavians, long before the worship of odiu
was establis e . ¹

n, We have here, in three grand dividens, a general geographical
description os Germany. The commentators inform us that they have
found compound words in the German language, signifyi‘ng first, the
inhabitants of the maritime parts} ley, inhabitants of the midland
cunuti-53 Saty, inhabitants of the eastz and those words cor-respond
with the three appellations, which the Romans sostened into their own
idiom. “

o The Vandals are the same as the V indiis mentioned by Pliny ς a ‘

brave and warlike race, who afterwards overran Gaul,Spain‚ and
Italy, and were finally destroyed in Ast-ica·
