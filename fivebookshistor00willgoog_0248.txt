w In the excellent translation of Monsieur Mallet's Ν orthem An·
tiqaities, we see the same custom observed by the Danas. They
still show the places where they chose their kings, their generals, mid
also deliberated on the most important affairs. There are remaining-
three monuments os this custom, the one near Lunden, in Scania, the
other at Leyra, or Lethra, in Zealand, and the third near viburg, in
J utland. ‘⁶ These monuments, whose rude bulk has preserved them
'from the‘ravages os time, 'are vast unhewn stenes, twelve in number,
set upright and ,placed in the form of a circle. In the middle is a
stone much larger than the rest, on which they made a seat for their
king, The other stones served as a barrier to keep off the populace.
The principal chiefs mounted on those stones, and with a loud voice
delivered their opinions; then the soldiers, who stood in crowds
’ about them, signified their approbation or assent by elashing their
shields together in a kind of cadence, or by raising certain shouts.⁹’

. Stonehenge is said to be a monument of the same custom. See

Camden’s Britannia, by Gibson, p. 95.

x From this it is evident that all the States of Germany were not
governed by king-s. The chief of the* eommunity implies a republi-
ραι] magistrate. The word civ-ilas does not mean a city, but a State,
a people, a body politic. In those States, where all important mat·
ters were discussed by the people in their collective body, no wonder
that the man who possessed the powers of persuasion should be the·
leading demagogue. The oratory os the savage was unpolished, but

' it was animated by the emotions of the heart3 and the heart is the

source of soreible and commanding eloquence.
