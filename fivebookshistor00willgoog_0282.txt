ο Maroboduus was king of the Marcomanniam. For an account
of him, and his alliance with the Romans against Arminius, see An-
mls, b. ii. s'. 46. With regard to Tudrus‚ the other pxince mentioned
by Tacitus, nothing 1s known 31 present.

p We are told by Tacitus that it was the policy of Rome, to make
even kings the instrumente of her ambition. With this view, the
emperors disposed os sceptres whenever an occasion offered itself; and

, accordingly, Tiberius, to keep 111 subjection a large body of German
emigrants, appointed Vannius to reign over them. Ananis, b. ii.
s. 63.

q History llas not left materiails sor an accurate account of the four
nations here enumerated. The commentators, however, assign their
territorias in the following manner. The Max-signinus dwelt on the
north· east of Bohemia, near Viadrus (now the Oder,) which risen in
Moravia, and runs through 8113313, Brandenbourg‚ and Pomerania‚
into the Baltie. The Gothinians inhabited part of Silesia, and Hun-
·gary. The Osians bordered on the last people‚ and extended as far
as the Danube. The Burians w'ere settled near the Krapack Moun-
tains, and the sources of the Vistula.

r Ptolemy mentions 11311- mines in or near the country of the Qua- “

¹ dians. The Gothinians laboured in those mines, and had, therefore,
says Tacitus, more reason to be ashained of their submission.

ὃ {bleffe are the mountains between Moravia‚Hunga1-y, Silesia,
an o emia.

e The nation os the Lygians inhabited part of Silesia, os Prussia
and Poland as far as the banks of the Vistula. They are mentioned
by Tacitus, Annals, b xii. s. 29.
