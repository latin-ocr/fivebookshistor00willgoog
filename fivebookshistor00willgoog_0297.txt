the conquest to that emperor, but sor this there does not seem to be
sufficient foundation. . · '

h Much has been said by the Greek and Roman poets os a piace
in the northern regions, called Thule3 but it is evident they did not
all agree in the geographical description: Camden is of opinion that
the Thule os Tacitus is one of the Slzetzand islanda, which lie to the
north of the Orcades, latit. 60. The ancient poets heard os Thule,
and made their own use os it, to adorn their verse. Thule wne, in
general, understood to be the most remote land to the northern lati-
tudes, but the exact local situation was not ascertained.

i. From vagae and uncertain accounts os the Frozen Ocean, the
ancients might form their idea of a sea in such a thick and concrete
state, that the cars could hardly move, and the winds scarcely agitate
such a sluggish mass of water. But the tranquility qs those seas has
been long known to be a mere fiction. lt is therefore needless to
examine the reasons migned by Tacitus, to account sor a phenomenou ·
which does not exist, ·
